"""#Summary: This code defines two variables, first_name and last_name,
storing the strings "ethan" and "smith" respectively.
It then combines them into a single full_name variable using an f-string, and
formats it with .title() to capitalize each word when building a greeting
message. Finally, it prints that message to the console, outputting
Hello, Ethan Smith!"""
