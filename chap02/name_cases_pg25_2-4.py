"""Summary: This code prompts the user for their name using input() and stores
it in the variable name,
then prints it three times using string methods:
.lower() makes every letter lowercase, .upper() makes every letter uppercase,
and .title() capitalizes the first letter of each word. The + operator is used
to join the label string with the transformed name before printing."""

name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Your name in lowercase is " + name.lower())
print("Your name in uppercase is " + name.upper())
print("Your name in title case is " + name.title())
